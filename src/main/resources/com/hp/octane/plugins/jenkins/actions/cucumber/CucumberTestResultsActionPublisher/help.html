    When using this action, Jenkins understands and reads the Cucumber test report XML structure.
    After reading the structure, Jenkins can provide useful information about Cucumber tests results to HPE ALM Octane.

    <p>
    To use the feature, ensure that you have added a Publish JUnit test results post-build action to your build.
    Then, specify the path to the Cucumber report XML files in the <a href="http://ant.apache.org/manual/Types/fileset.html">Ant glob syntax</a>.
    Be sure not to include any non-Cucumber-report files in this path. You can specify multiple patterns by separating them with commas.
